As a longtime fan, I want to listen to the back catalog so that I can reminisce on classic songs.

As a potential fan, I want to find information about the band the so that I can develop knowledge on the band.

As a booking agent, I want to find out if the band are available so that I an book them for an event.

To get you started, we included a small hello world application.

1) Open the hello-world.html file

2) Click on the Preview button to open a live preview pane

3) Make some changes to the file, save, watch the preview, and have fun!

Happy coding!
