# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This site was developed from the brief enlisted by Code Institute. The intended goal of this site was to help The 1960's rock band **The Monkees** showcase their music & publicise their availability to perform at events.

The primary target audience are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to view & hear clips from their back catalog and any new material as it becomes available.

Within this project I will be using everything that I have learnt thus far from Code Institue.
This project will utilise my experience of **HTML5**, **CSS3** & the little knowledge I have of **JS**.

## UX

The intended UX is simplistic & clean to help new users navigate fluidly & keeps a common website format. Using whites & greys to organise content these subtle effects help for a minimal approach & intentionally leaver the user feeling comfortable. I have used a dark grey as the call to action colour used within the two landing page buttons & within the footer to help the user understand where the important information they may need is situated.

A prominent article I read called "Your body text is too small" has been at the forefront of my design process the whole way through. Making sure all h1's are clear & lead whilst minimising information on **h2/h3/h4** text to help user find fluidiity in scrolling.

## Features 

* **Navbar Logo & Home Link** -These both act as a **'Back To Top'** button for user reference. 

* **Navbar Menu** - Bootstrap hamburger menu used for smaller devices to help users navigate on mobile/tablet.

* **Landing Section** - Large hero/showcase image to introduce the band. The use of buttons using text such as **'Meet Us!'** & **'Book Us!'** not only provide immediate calls to action to help the user fulfill their needs but also notifies the user that this an official website as the buttons use a 1st person narrative which intend initiate a personal feeling.

* **Band Section** - Images sourced from Google & bio button links to band member's Wiki page.

* **Music Section** - Audio provided by CI & hover effect implemented via: [Kevin Powell](https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/dWzGox).

* **Video Section** - Downloaded (YouTube) & hosted locally & Uploaded to c9.

* **Connect Section** - Using social icons to apply the briefs request of creating a social media presence. Large & strongly set at the bottom to notify the user the website content is coming to an end & if they want to see more they can browse these links.

* **Contact Section** - Brief, simple & straight to the point including various methods of contact.
